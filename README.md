## Description

As acute labor shortages and brain drain are being
monitored in Europe, the demand for experienced specialists and
labor in various fields is increasing. One such field is agriculture,
specifically the olive industry. As the olive industry is one of
the significant aspects of agriculture in the Mediterranean part
of Europe, the solution would be vital. To address this issue,
we are introducing - the “Olive Ripeness Detection System.”,
an automated image-processing tool designed to estimate the
ripeness of olives accurately. Our system is a prerequisite system
for automated means of harvesting high-quality olive fruits in
organic farms, which provides data-driven decisions for the
farmers.
